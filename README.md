# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rylee!

I'm a Computer Science master's student with a background in psychology and 4+ years of experience in client-facing healthcare roles. I love building user-first, intuitive apps that blend tech with real human needs.

I'm currently seeking **full-time software engineering opportunities for Spring/Summer 2026**, especially in backend, full-stack, or product-focused roles.
