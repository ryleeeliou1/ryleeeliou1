# 👋 Hey there, I'm Rylee!

I am a Master's student in Computer Science (Software Engineering concentration), passionate about building reliable and intuitive systems and applications. My background in psychology and client-facing healthcare roles has shaped how I approach my projects: user-focused and grounded in real-world needs. 

I'm currently seeking **early-career software engineering opportunities for Spring/Summer 2026**, especially in backend, full-stack, or product-focused roles.

# 💻 Featured Work (Rebuilding and Updating) 
I'm in the process of refreshing my GitHub to showcase intentional and well-rounded projects. Here is what I am working on and releasing soon: 

## MRC Database Application (Python + MySQL)

A full three-tier architecture (GUI → Business Logic → Data Access) interacting with stored procedures and functions. 
#### Currently documenting for GitHub release.

## Daily Reflection Journal (Rebuild in Progress)

A polished, modern version of my journaling app with improved structure, database design, and UI flow.

## Algorithm Portfolio

A curated set of dynamic programming, graph, recursion, and sorting implementations with explanations.

# What I'm Focusing on Now

- Strengthening my backend engineering skills (Python, Java, SQL)
- Designing database schemas with multi-layered architecture
- Brushing up on algorithm & data structures (through LeetCode + coursework)
- Build repositories that closely mirror real-world engineering practices
