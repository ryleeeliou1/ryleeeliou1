# 👋 Hi, I’m Rylee

I’m a **backend-focused software engineer** building **data-driven systems** with Python and MySQL.

I design **relational databases**, write **stored-procedure-driven APIs**, and build **business-logic layers** that validate, transform, and persist user data. My background in healthcare and psychology shapes how I build systems — with an emphasis on **data integrity, reliability, and real-world workflows**.

I’m currently completing my **M.S. in Computer Science (Software Engineering)** and graduating in **May 2026**, and I’m exploring **junior backend and data engineering roles** (remote, Philadelphia, or Pittsburgh).
